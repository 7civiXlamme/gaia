## Method 1: Using Easy Printer Manager Software
 
Easy Printer Manager is a software that allows you to manage your printer settings and monitor its status. You can download it from [HP's official website](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/samsung-scx-3405-laser-multifunction-printer-series/17157049/model/17157053), since Samsung printers are now supported by HP. Follow these steps to reset the firmware using Easy Printer Manager:
 
1. Connect your printer to your computer via USB cable.
2. Open Easy Printer Manager and select your printer.
3. Click on Advanced Settings and enter the password (the default is sec00000).
4. Click on Maintenance and then Firmware Upgrade.
5. Select the firmware file that you want to install and click Open.
6. Click OK to start the firmware upgrade process.
7. Wait until the process is completed and do not turn off the printer or disconnect the USB cable.
8. Restart your printer and check if the firmware has been reset successfully.

## Method 2: Using a USB Flash Drive
 
If you do not have Easy Printer Manager software or you cannot access it due to a lost password, you can also reset the firmware using a USB flash drive. You will need a USB flash drive with at least 256 MB of free space and a firmware file that matches your printer model and serial number. You can find the firmware file on [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wILvBelTs), which also shows you how to create a fix firmware reset for your printer. Follow these steps to reset the firmware using a USB flash drive:

1. Download the firmware file from the YouTube video and save it on your computer.
2. Format your USB flash drive as FAT32 and copy the firmware file to it.
3. Turn off your printer and insert the USB flash drive into its USB port.
4. Press and hold the Stop button on your printer and turn it on.
5. Release the Stop button when you see "Downloading" on the display.
6. Wait until the process is completed and do not turn off the printer or remove the USB flash drive.
